                    Coco is not your average hotel in Copenhagen. Sure, it’s a place to stay away from home, 
                    but it is also a place to unwind, a place to meet with friends, a place to meet new people, 
                    a place to explore, a place to be inspired and a place to feel wanted. We welcome everyone at
                    Coco Hotel and value outstanding hospitality above all. Want to know more about the hotel?
